These quotes are powerful teachings from the Stoic philosophers—**Marcus Aurelius**, **Seneca**, and **Epictetus**.

### 🔹 “We are often more frightened than hurt; and we suffer more from imagination than from reality.” — **Seneca**

> Your mind exaggerates problems. Often, fear is worse than the actual situation. Don’t let your imagination create pain that doesn’t exist.

---

### 🔹 “It’s silly to try to escape other people’s faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own.” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> You can’t change others. People will be flawed. Focus on improving yourself instead—that’s within your control.

---

### 🔹 “Our life is what our thoughts make it.” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> Your mindset shapes your reality. Positive, rational thoughts create a meaningful life. Negative, anxious thoughts will ruin it.

---

### 🔹 “Don’t explain your philosophy. Embody it.” — **Epictetus**

> Don’t preach or show off your beliefs—**live** them. Actions speak louder than words.

---

### 🔹 “If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill—of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you but answer, ‘He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone.’” — **Epictetus**

> Be humble. When people criticize you, don’t defend yourself. Accept your flaws calmly, even joke about them—it shows real strength.

---

### 🔹 “If it is not right, do not do it; if it is not true, do not say it.” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> A simple rule for a moral life: if something feels wrong or dishonest, avoid it.

---

### 🔹 “You become what you give your attention to… If you yourself don’t choose what thoughts and images you expose yourself to, someone else will.” — **Epictetus**

> Guard your attention. The content you consume (social media, news, people) shapes you. Be intentional with what you focus on.

---

### 🔹 “Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> Forgive others for their mistakes. But hold yourself to higher standards. You’re responsible for your actions, not theirs.

---

### 🔹 “You always own the option of having no opinion...” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> You don’t have to react to everything. Stay calm. Let go of things you can’t control—they don’t need your judgment.

---

### 🔹 “All you need are these: certainty of judgment... attitude of gratitude...” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> In each moment:

- Think clearly
    
- Act for others
    
- Be grateful for what happens  
    That’s the Stoic formula for peace.

### 🔹 “No person has the power to have everything they want... cheerfully put to good use what they do have.” — **Seneca**

> You won’t get everything. But you can be happy with what you already have—**and use it well**. That’s true wealth.

---

### 🔹 “If anyone can refute me... I’ll gladly change...” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> Stay humble. If someone shows you that you’re wrong, **be glad**—you just got closer to truth. Never let ego block your growth.

---

### 🔹 “Today I escaped anxiety. Or no, I discarded it...” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> Anxiety is not out there—it’s inside your thoughts. Let go of it by **changing your perception**, not the world.

---

### 🔹 “You have power over your mind – not outside events...” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> External events are out of your hands. But how you **respond** to them is up to you. That’s your true power.

---

### 🔹 “It isn’t events themselves that disturb people, but only their judgements about them.” — **Epictetus**

> Nothing is _good_ or _bad_ by itself. It’s how you **interpret** it that causes peace or suffering.

---

### 🔹 “To be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over...” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> Be mentally strong like a rock. Let life’s chaos hit you—but don’t let it shake your inner calm.

---

### 🔹 “First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.” — **Epictetus**

> Decide what kind of person you want to be. Then take actions every day to **become** that person.

---

### 🔹 “Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be One.” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> Don’t talk or debate about being good. **Just be good**—in your thoughts, choices, and actions.

---

### 🔹 “The primary indication of a well-ordered mind is a man’s ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company.” — **Seneca**

> If your mind is calm and healthy, you’ll enjoy your own company. You won’t constantly seek distractions or people to escape yourself.

---

### 🔹 “Receive without pride, let go without attachment.” — **Marcus Aurelius**

> Accept success **humbly**. Let go of loss **peacefully**. Don’t cling to anything too tightly—it’s all temporary.
