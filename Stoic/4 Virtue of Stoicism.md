### Summary of All 4 Virtues in Action:

> You face the breakup (🧠 wisdom),  
> you endure the pain without breaking (💪 courage),  
> you resist texting her or reacting (⚖️ temperance),  
> and you still treat others with kindness (⚖️ justice).

That’s Stoicism in action. That’s **real strength**.

If you want a **Stoic cheat code**, remember this quote from Marcus Aurelius:

> _“If it is not right, do not do it.  
> If it is not true, do not say it.”_



## Courage

> “The world wants to know if you have cojones. If you are brave?”

The Stoics might have phrased this a bit differently. [Seneca](https://dailystoic.com/seneca/) would say that he actually pitied people who have never experienced misfortune. “You have passed through life without an opponent,” he said, “No one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you.”

The world wants to know what category to put you in, which is why it will occasionally send difficult situations your way. Think of these not as inconveniences or even tragedies but as opportunities, as questions to answers. Do I have cojones? Am I brave? Am I going to face this problem or run away from it? Will I stand up or be rolled over?

Let your actions etch a response into the record—and let them remind you of why courage is the most important thing.


## Temperance
 Of course, life is not so simple as to say that courage is all the counts. While everyone would admit that courage is essential, we are also all well aware of people whose bravery turns to recklessness and becomes a fault when they begin to endanger themselves and others. 

This is where Aristotle comes in. Aristotle actually used courage as the main example in his famous metaphor of a “Golden Mean.” On one end of the spectrum, he said, there was cowardice—that’s a deficiency of courage. On the other, there was recklessness—too much courage. What was called for, what we required then, was a golden mean. The right amount.

That’s what Temperance or moderation is about: Doing nothing in excess. Doing the right thing in the right amount in the right way. Because “We are what we repeatedly do,” Aristotle also said, “therefore excellence is not an act, but a habit.”

In other words: Virtue and excellence is a way of living. It’s foundational. It’s like an operating system [and the code this system operates on is habit.](https://dailystoic.com/stephen-guise-interview/?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=convertkit&utm_campaign=repeatedly-do)

[As Epictetus would later say](https://dailystoic.com/epictetus/?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=convertkit&utm_campaign=repeatedly-do), “capability is confirmed and grows in its corresponding actions, walking by walking, and running by running… therefore, if you want to do something, make a habit of it.” So if we want to be happy, if we want to be successful, if we want to be great, we have to develop the capability, we have to develop the day-to-day habits that allow this to _ensue._

This is great news. Because it means that impressive results or enormous changes are possible without herculean effort or magic formulas. Small adjustments, good systems, the right processes—that’s what it takes.



Sure Pranav, here's a simple explanation of that passage:

---

**Courage is good — but too much can be reckless. Too little is cowardice.**

That’s where **Aristotle’s “Golden Mean”** comes in:  
→ **Virtue lies in balance**, not in extremes.

So instead of being **too brave (reckless)** or **too scared (coward)**, the goal is to be **moderately courageous — just enough, at the right time, in the right way**.

That’s what **temperance (moderation)** means:  
➡️ **Do things in the right amount.**  
➡️ **Avoid extremes.**  
➡️ **Make it a habit.**

As **Epictetus** said: You become good at walking by walking, running by running — same with being good at life:  
➡️ **Practice the habit of doing the right thing every day.**

And that’s the real secret:  
📌 **You don’t need big effort. You just need small, consistent good habits.**

## Justice
Being brave. Finding the right balance. These are core Stoic virtues, but in their seriousness, they pale in comparison to what the Stoics worshipped most highly: Doing the right thing. 

There is no Stoic virtue more important than justice, because it influences all the others. [Marcus Aurelius](https://dailystoic.com/marcus-aurelius/) himself said that justice is “the source of all the other virtues.” Stoics throughout history have pushed and advocated for justice, oftentimes at great personal risk and with great courage, in order to do great things and defend the people and ideas that they loved. 

- Cato gave his life trying to restore the Roman Republic.
- And Thrasea and Agrippinus gave theirs resisting the tyranny of Nero.
- George Washington and Thomas Jefferson formed a new nation—one which would seek, however imperfectly, to fight for democracy and justice—largely inspired by the philosophy of Cato and those other Stoics.
- Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a translator of [Epictetus](https://dailystoic.com/epictetus/), led a black regiment of troops in the US Civil War.
- Beatrice Webb, who helped to found the London School of Economics and who first conceptualized the idea of collective bargaining, regularly re-read [Marcus Aurelius](https://dailystoic.com/marcus-aurelius/).

Countless other activists and politicians have turned to Stoicism to gird them against the difficulty of fighting for ideals that mattered, to guide them towards what was right in a world of so much wrong. A Stoic must deeply believe that an individual can make a difference. Successful activism and political maneuvering require understanding and strategy, as well as realism… and hope. It requires wisdom, acceptance and also a refusal to accept the statue quo. 

It was James Baldwin who most brilliantly captured this tension in _Notes of a Native Son_:

_It began to seem that one would have to hold in mind forever two ideas which seemed to be in opposition. The first idea was acceptance, the acceptance, totally without rancor, of life as it is, and men as they are: in light of this idea it goes without saying that injustice is commonplace. But this did not mean that one could be complacent, for the second idea was of equal power: that one must never, in one’s own life, accept these injustices as commonplace but one must fight them with all one’s strength._

A Stoic sees the world clearly…but also sees clearly what the world can be. And then they are brave, and strategic enough to help bring it into reality.


Here’s a short and simple explanation of that passage:

In Stoicism, **justice** is the most important virtue. It means doing what’s right—not just for yourself, but for others too. Stoics believed you must **stand up for truth and fairness**, even when it’s hard or dangerous.

Great people like Marcus Aurelius, Cato, and even modern figures used Stoic ideas to **fight injustice and build a better world**, despite the risks. The Stoic mindset says:  
👉 _See the world honestly, accept what you can’t control, but never accept injustice as “normal.”_  
You must **have hope, be wise, and take action** to improve the world around you.

In short:

> **Don’t just live for yourself—live to make things better.** That’s real Stoic strength.



## Wisdom
Courage. Temperance. Justice. These are the critical virtues of life. But what situations call for courage? What is the right amount? What is the right thing? This is where the final and essential virtue comes in: Wisdom. The _knowing._ The _learning._ The _experience_ required to navigate the world. 

Wisdom has always been prized by the Stoics. Zeno said that we were given two ears and one mouth for a reason: to listen more than we talk. And since we have two eyes, we are obligated to read and observe more than we talk as well. 

It is key today, as it was in the ancient world, to  be able to distinguish between the vast aggregations of information that lay out there at your disposal—and the actual wisdom that you need to live a good life. It’s key that we study, that we keep our minds open always. _You cannot learn that which you think you already know,_ Epictetus said. It’s true. 

Which is why we need to not only be humble students but also seek out great teachers. It’s why we should always be reading. It’s why we cannot stop training. It’s why we have to be diligent in filtering out the signal from the noise. 

The goal is not just to acquire information, but the _right_ kind of information. It’s the lessons found in [_Meditations_](https://dailystoic.com/meditations-marcus-aurelius/), in everything from the actual Epictetus to James Stockdale entering the world of Epictetus. It’s the key facts, standing out from the background noise, that you need to absorb.

Thousands of years of blazing insight are available to the world. It is likely that you have the power to learn anything you want at your fingertips. So today, honor the Stoic virtue of wisdom by slowing down, being deliberate, and finding the wisdom you need.

Two eyes, two ears, one mouth. Remain a student. Act accordingly—and wisely.
