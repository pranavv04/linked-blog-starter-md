## Time complexity
   it measures for how long an algorithm takes to run, typically as a function of the input size.

Not the actual time taken but **amount of time taken as function of input size(n).**

## Space complexity
   measures the amount of memory (or storage) an algorithm requires to the input size


Amount of space taken by an algorithm as function of input size(n)


**Both are often expressed using Big O notation**




## Big O Notation
   simple that gives worst case complexity (upper bound).


## Rules
 - Ignore constants => 4n[^2]+3n+5  => ignore 4,3,5
 - Take largest term => n^2+n+1 => ignore 1 and n cause they are not largest
     answer => n^2




Time complexity is important then space complexity but both are important
