#operatingsystem/types/batch
- This OS do not interact with the computer directly.
- There is an operator which takes similar jobs having same requirement and group them into batches
- It is the responsibility of operator operator to sort the jobs with similar needs.

## Time-Sharing Operating System
#operatingsystem/types/timesharingOS
- Each task has given some time to execute, so that all the tasks work smoothly. 
- Each user gets time of CPU as they use single system.
- These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems.
- The task can be from single user or from different users also.
- The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum.
- After this time interval is over OS switches over to next task

## Distributed Operating System
#operatingsystem/types/distributed
- These types of operating system is recent advancement in the world of computer technology and are being widely accepted all-over the world.
- Various autonomous interconnected computers communicate each other using a shared communication network
- Independent systems possess their own memory unit and CPU.
- These are referred as **loosely coupled systems** or distributed system
- These systems processors differ in sizes and functions.
- The major benefit of working with these OS is that it is possible to access files or software that is not present that one user can access the files or software which are not present on his system but on some other system is connected within network i.e remote access is enabled within the devices connected in that network.

## Network Operating System
- These systems runs on a server and provides the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications and other networking functions.
- These types of operating systems allows shared access of files, printers, security, applications, and other networking functions over a small private network
