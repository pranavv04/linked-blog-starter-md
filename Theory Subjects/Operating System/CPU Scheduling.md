- CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state).
- The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.
- Whenever the CPU becomes idle, the operating system must select one of the processes in the ready queue to be executed.
- The selection process is carried out by the short-term scheduler (or CPU scheduler)
- The scheduler selects from among the processes in memory that are ready to execute, and allocates the CPU to one of them.


## CPU Scheduling: Dispatcher
- Another component involved in the CPU scheduling function is the Dispatcher.
- The dispatcher is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler.
