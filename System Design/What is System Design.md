- Optimize processes and increase throughput using the same resources => vertical scaling
- Preparing beforehand at non-peak hours  => preprocessing & cron jobs
- Keep backups and avoid single points of failure => backups 
- Hire more resources  => horizontal scaling
- Microservice architecture
- Distributed System (Partitioning)
- Load Balancer
- Decoupling
- Logging and Metrics calculations
- Extensible



1: vertical scaling: optimise precision and increase through put with the same resources
2: preprossing (e.g cron job) : prepare before hand during non pick hours 
3: Backups: keep backups and avoid single point of failure 
4: horizontal scaling: get more resources 
5: micro service architecture 
6: distributed system (partioning) 
7: load distribution
8: Decoupling 
9: Logging 
10: extensible
